## Overview

### The challenge

Users can be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
-   Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
-   Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
-   Hide/show the board sidebar
-   Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
-   Bonus: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
